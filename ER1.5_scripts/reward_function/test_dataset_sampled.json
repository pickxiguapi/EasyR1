      "answer": "The task failed because the robot arm was unable to grasp the fork successfully. During the grasping phase, the arm did not reach the appropriate position to align with the fork, resulting in it missing the target entirely. The misalignment prevented the gripper from properly engaging with the fork, which is critical for the subsequent actions in the task sequence. The failure can be attributed to a deviation in the expected positioning of the end-effector when attempting to grasp the object, leading directly to task completion failure.",
